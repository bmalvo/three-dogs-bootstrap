<h1>Contributing</h1><br>
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Reporting a bug</li>
<li>Discussing the current state of the code</li>
<li>Submitting a fix</li>
<li>Proposing new features</li>
<li>Becoming a maintainer</li>
</ul>
  
We Develop with Github<br>
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.<br>

We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests<br>
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:<br><br>

<ol>  
<li>Fork the repo and create your branch from main.</li>
<li>If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.</li>
<li>Ensure the test suite passes.</li>
<li>Make sure your code lints.</li>
<li>Issue that pull request!</li>
</ol><br><br>
<h2>Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License</h2><br>
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

<h2>Report bugs using Github's issues</h2><br>
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!<br>

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code<br>
Great Bug Reports tend to have:<br>
<ul>  
<li>A quick summary and/or background</li>
<li>Steps to reproduce</li>
<li>Give sample code if you can</li>
<li>What you expected would happen</li>
<li>What actually happens</li>
<li>Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)</li>
</ul>
People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.<br>
Use a Consistent Coding Style<br>
2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs<br>
